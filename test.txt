In the EXISTING SYSTEM, File consistency maintenance in P2P systems does not guarantee the upadation or modification among the Replica Nodes. It is high overhead.. In the PROPOSED SYSTEM, to handle these challenges, this paper introduces a poll-based distributed file consistency maintenance method called geographically aware wave (GeWave). Owner node identifies its Members with respect to its TTR (Time to Refresh) value. The distribution ensures continuous data update among all the replica nodes. We use Chord Algorithm to communicate with Predecessor and Successor Nodes. In the MODIFICATION, Index Filter is achieved, Every Root node will maintain the Index data of rest of the Files present in its nearest Root Node. This process helps to search any data very easily.  I would like to work in an organisation so that I can apply and utilize my knowledge and skills which would enable me to grow while fulfilling the needs and goals of the organisation.
